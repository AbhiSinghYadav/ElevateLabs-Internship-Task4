# SQL for Data Analysis â€“ E-Commerce Dataset

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is part of my **Data Analyst Internship** task.  
The goal was to perform SQL queries on a relational **e-commerce database** to extract meaningful insights and demonstrate the use of key SQL concepts.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The database consists of multiple related tables:
- **brands** â€“ Brand details

- **orders** â€“ Order information
- **products** â€“ Product details
- **staffs** â€“ Staff members in stores
- **stocks** â€“ Store stock availability
- **stores** â€“ Store information
